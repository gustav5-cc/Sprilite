## Turn 2d sprite into normal maps for enhanced lighting with 1/2 the work

This program uses javascript to turn your image into a normal map with one click.

To use the program copy the src to your machine, simply navigate to the directory 
these files are in on your command line, then type "start .\index/html" to open up 
the converter program file wise. 

Using it is fairly simple, just upload images, preferably sprites and it 
will do the conversions automatically.
